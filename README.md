# faceBox
> A very simple script that tracks faces

I found it a pain in the rear to get started with OpenCV so this is the starting point I created for myself for any OpenCV projects I might have.

**This script:**
- Takes input from your webcam
- Draws a box around all the faces in frame
- Outputs X and Y values of the faces
